        <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.</p>
          <p>Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
<p>
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
<p>
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting and was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.</p>
<p>
Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.</p> 
        <p>Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.</p> 
        <p>In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project. Guido van Rossum has since then withdrawn his nomination for the 2020 Steering council.</p>
<p>Some versions of python: </p>
<ul><li>Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.</li>
<li>
Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Many of its major features were backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series. Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</li>
<li>
Python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6.x and later are supported.</li>
<li>
Python 3.9.2 and 3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues, leading to possible remote code execution and web cache poisoning.</li></ul>

      <header>Design philosophy and features</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic methods)). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming.</p>
<p>
Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It also features dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.</p>
<p>
Python's design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.</p>
<p>
The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as: </p>
<ul><li>
Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
<p>Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible (with modules). This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.</p>
<p>          
Python strives for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl's <em>"there is more than one way to do it"</em> motto, Python embraces a <i>"there should be one— and preferably only one —obvious way to do it"</i> design philosophy. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, writes that <b>"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture."</b></p>
<p>
Python's developers strive to avoid premature optimization, and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. When speed is important, a Python programmer can move time-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or use PyPy, a just-in-time compiler. Cython is also available, which translates a Python script into C and makes direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.</p>
<p>
An important goal of Python's developers is keeping it fun to use. This is reflected in the language's name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as examples that refer to spam and eggs (from a famous Monty Python sketch) instead of the standard foo and bar.</p>
<p>
A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language, that it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.</p>
<p>
Users and admirers of Python, especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced, are often referred to as Pythonistas.

      <header>Indentation</header>
      <article><p>Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents the program's semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule, which some other languages share, but in most languages indentation doesn't have any semantic meaning.
      </p>  <p>The recommended indent size is four spaces.</p>

        Python's statements include (among others): </p>
<ul><li>
The <code style="color: blue;">assignment</code> statement, using a single equals sign =.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">if</code> statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">for</code> statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">while</code> statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">try</code> statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">raise</code> statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">class</code> statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">def</code> statement, which defines a function or method.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">with</code> statement, from Python 2.5 released in September 2006, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replaces a common try/finally idiom.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">break</code> statement, exits from a loop.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">continue</code> statement, skips this iteration and continues with the next item.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">del</code> statement, removes a variable, which means the reference from the name to the value is deleted and trying to use that variable will cause an error. A deleted variable can be reassigned.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">pass</code> statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">assert</code> statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that should apply.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">yield</code> statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">return</code> statement, used to return a value from a function.</li>
<li>The <code style="color: blue;">import</code> statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.</li></ul>

      <header>Expressions</header>
      <article>
        <p>Some Python expressions are similar to those found in languages such as C and Java, while some are not: </p>
<ul><li>
Addition, subtraction, and multiplication are the same, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python. They are floor division (or integer division) <code>//</code> and floating-point/division. Python also uses the <code>**</code> operator for exponentiation.</li>
<li>From Python 3.5, the new <code>@</code> infix operator was introduced. It is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.</li>
<li>From Python 3.8, the syntax <code>:=</code>, called the 'walrus operator' was introduced. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.</li>
<li>In Python, <code>==</code> compares by value, versus Java, which compares numerics by value and objects by reference. (Value comparisons in Java on objects can be performed with the <code>equals()</code> method.) Python's <code>is</code> operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). In Python, comparisons may be chained, for example <code>a <= b <= c</code>.</li>
<li>Python uses the words <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic <code>&&</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code> used in Java and C.</li>
<li>Python has a type of expression termed a list comprehension as well as a more general expression termed a generator expression.</li>
<li>Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be one expression.</li>
<li>Conditional expressions in Python are written as <code>x if c else y</code> (different in order of operands from the <code>c ? x : y</code> operator common to many other languages).</li>
<li>Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples are written as <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The <code>+</code> operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples. Thus, given the variable <code>t</code> initially equal to <code>(1, 2, 3)</code>, executing <code>t = t + (4, 5)</code> first evaluates <code>t + (4, 5)</code>, which yields <code>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</code>, which is then assigned back to <code>t</code>, thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of <code>t</code>, while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.</li>
<li>Python features sequence unpacking wherein multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to (a variable, a writable property, etc.), are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it, assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.</li>
<li>Python has a "string format" operator <code>%</code>. This functions analogously to <code>printf</code> format strings in C, e.g. <code>"spam=%s eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2)</code> evaluates to <code>"spam=blah eggs=2"</code>. In Python 3 and 2.6+, this was supplemented by the <code>format()</code> method of the <code>str</code> class, e.g. <code>"spam={0} eggs={1}".format("blah", 2)</code>. Python 3.6 added <code>"f-strings": blah = "blah"; eggs = 2; f'spam={blah} eggs={eggs}'</code>.</li>
<li>Strings in Python can be concatenated, by "adding" them (same operator as for adding integers and floats). E.g. <code>"spam" + "eggs"</code> returns <code>"spameggs"</code>. Even if your strings contain numbers, they are still added as strings rather than integers. E.g. <code>"2" + "2"</code> returns <code>"22"</code>.</li>
<li>Python has various kinds of string literals: </li>
<ul><li>Strings delimited by single or double quote marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perl-influenced languages, single quote marks and double quote marks function identically. Both kinds of string use the backslash <code>(\)</code> as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as "formatted string literals".</li>
<li>Triple-quoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks. They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl and Ruby.</li>
<li>Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with an <code>r</code>. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. Compare "<code>@</code>-quoting" in C#.</li></ul>
<li>Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists, denoted as <code>a[key]</code>, <code>a[start:stop]</code> or <code>a[start:stop:step]</code>. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted, for example <code>a[:]</code> returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.</li>
<p>In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:</p>
<ul><li>
List comprehensions vs. <code>for</code>-loops</li>
<li>Conditional expressions vs. <code>if</code> blocks</li>
<li>The <code>eval()</code> vs. <code>exec()</code> built-in functions (in Python 2, <code>exec</code> is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements.</li>

        <p>
          Methods on objects are functions attached to the object's <code>class</code>; the syntax <code>instance.method(argument)</code> is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for <code>Class.method(instance, argument)</code>. Python methods have an explicit <code>self</code> parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit <code>self</code> (or <code>this</code>) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, or Ruby).

      <header>Typing</header>
      <article>
        <p>Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.</p>
<p>
Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, <code>SpamClass()</code> or <code>EggsClass()</code>), and the classes are instances of the metaclass <code>type</code> (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.</p>
<p>
Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class <code>object</code> is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from <code>object</code> and are instances of <code>type</code>). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.</p>
<p>
The long-term plan is to support gradual typing and from Python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, CPython. An experimental optional static type checker named <em>mypy</em> supports compile-time type checking.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="ARITHMATIC_OPERATIONS">
      <header>Arithmatic operations</header>
      <article>
        <p>Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>), the floor division operator <code>//</code> and the modulo operation <code>%</code> (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. <code>4 % -3 == -2</code>). It also has <code>**</code> for exponentiation, e.g. <code>5**3 == 125</code> and <code>9**0.5 == 3.0</code>, and a matrix multiply operator <code>@</code> . These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix ( <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).</p>
<p>
The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time: </p>
<ul><li>
Python 2.1 and earlier used C's division behavior. The <code>/</code> operator is integer division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division otherwise. Integer division rounds towards <code>0</code>, e.g. <code>7/3 == 2</code> and <code>-7/3 == -2</code>.</li>
<li>Python 2.2 changed integer division to round towards negative infinity, e.g. <code>7/3 == 2</code> and <code>-7/3 == -3</code>. The floor division <code>//</code> operator was introduced. So <code>7//3 == 2</code>, <code>-7//3 == -3</code>, <code>7.5//3 == 2.0</code> and <code>-7.5//3 == -3.0</code>. Adding <code>from __future__ import</code> division causes a module to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see next).</li>
<li>Python 3.0 changed <code>/</code> to always be floating-point division, e.g. <code>5/2 == 2.5</code>.</li>

        <p>Python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.</p>
<p>
Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but most modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.</p>

        <p>Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately.</p>
<p>
Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention and syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>
As well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are Web browser-based IDEs; SageMath (intended for developing science and math-related Python programs); PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computing.</p>

        <p>Python's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.</p>
<p>
Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at bugs.python.org. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.</p>
<p>
CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented: </p>
<ul><li>
Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.</li>
<li>Major or "feature" releases, occurred about every 18 months but with the adoption of a yearly release cadence starting with Python 3.9 are expected to happen once a year. They are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.</li>
<li>Bugfix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.</li></ul>

        <p>Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of February 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C). It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for "the highest rise in ratings in a year") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times).</p>
<p>
An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often "better than Java and not much worse than C or C++".</p>
<p>
Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify and some smaller entities like ILM and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.</p>
<p>
Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod_wsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.</p>
<p>
Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a mathematical software with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.</p>
<p>
Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn. As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.</p>
<p>
Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.</p>
<p>
Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, OpenBSD (as a package) and macOS and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.</p>
<p>
Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.</p>
<p>
Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, now developed at Sugar Labs, is written in Python. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.</p>
<p>
LibreOffice includes Python, and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.</p>
